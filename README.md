# Positive-or-Negative

Input: -12.5

Output: Negative

Question Explanation:

The program is designed to determine whether a given number N is positive or negative. 

Logical Approach:

Read Input:
Read the input number N and convert it to a float. This allows the program to handle both integer and decimal numbers.

Check if N is Positive or Negative:
Use an if-else statement to evaluate the sign of N.
If N is greater than 0, it is positive.
Else, if N is less than 0, it is negative.

Output:
If N is positive, print "Positive".
If N is negative, print "Negative".

Example for Clarity:

If the input N is -12.5:
Since -12.5 is less than 0, the number is negative.
The output will be "Negative".

If the input N is 15.2:
Since 15.2 is greater than 0, the number is positive.

The output will be "Positive".
